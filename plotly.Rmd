### Create the interactive plot to examine the relationship between Girth, Height and Volume by using the default R dataset 'trees'.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)

plot_ly(trees, x = ~Height, y = ~Volume, color = ~Girth) %>%
    layout(title = "Girth, Height and Volume for Black Cherry Trees",
           xaxis = list(title = "Height", ticksuffix = "ft"),
           yaxis = list(title = "Volume"))

```
