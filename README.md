# Developing-Data-Products-Shiny-Application

This is a Shiny App for top 100 highest earning e-sports player in last 4 years. I choose from 2013 because that is the time which the famous FPS game Counter Strike: Global Offensive came out in. I select 5 games with highest prize pool and top 100 players every year. I only choose top 100, otherwise there might be a great gap  between top 1's and top 500's earning.

The data set is from [esportsearnings.com](https://www.esportsearnings.com/).
